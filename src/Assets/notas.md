Acerca de este juego
Mind Over Magic is a colony simulation game developed by Sparkypants and published by Klei Publishing.

Build and optimize a magic school while keeping powerful mages alive and inspired. Prepare them to explore the horrors of the Underschool, a deadly subterranean gauntlet. Study lost arcana, grow exotic plants, brew potions, and raise undead servants. But don’t forget to stop the deadly fog from consuming everything in its path.

Conjure Your Own Magic School
Build the ultimate magic school, brick by brick. Design every room to fit your vision. Unlock new furniture, wallpaper, lighting, and decorations to personalize every detail. Experiment with layouts to discover hidden efficiency bonuses and create the perfect balance of design and function.

Explore the Deadly Underschool
Beneath your school lies a mysterious labyrinth filled with dark secrets, deadly magic, and ghastly creatures. The deeper you explore, the greater the rewards—but danger doesn’t always stay underground.

Raise Magical Beasts & Unlock Their Potential
Research and discover mystical beasts to serve your school and unlock powerful new resources. These creatures require food, affection, and magical care to grow into valuable allies, providing rare materials for crafting and construction.

If you're truly ambitious, tackle the challenge of raising a dragon to aid your school. Dragons demand specialized students to become caretakers, but in return, they grant your mages the ability to embark on daring quests beyond the school walls—uncovering secrets, gaining unique powers, and shaping the future of your academy.

Let Magic Do the Heavy Lifting
Bend the arcane to your will. Practitioners of Dark magic animate undead helpers known as Quilted—specialized constructs that gather resources, tend to plants, repair damage to your school, and mine valuable materials.

Make the most of your day by reducing travel time in your ever-growing campus with the power of flight. Strategically place broom racks to make traversal a breeze.

A Mage’s Growth is in Your Hands
Enhance your students abilities with powerful gear, such as potions, relics, and increasingly powerful wands, each granting distinct magical advantages. Customize their daily schedules and assign teachers to shape their magical growth.

Magic isn’t just for combat—what your students learn and the tools they wield also determine how effectively they contribute to your school’s daily operations. Build a curriculum that fosters the ability to both survive and thrive.

Teach And Master Magic
Shape the future of magic by customizing your students' education. Apprenticed students can multiclass to wield a diverse array of spells, or strive towards single discipline mastery to unlock devastating ultimate abilities, powerful enough to face the dangers of the Nexus.

Reality is tenuous in the Nexus, a fractured realm of pure magic deep beneath the school. Your mages will need every advantage to battle powerful enemies, reconstitute its crumbling fragments, and break the curse for good. Train wisely, for only the most skilled mages can withstand the challenges that await beyond the veil.
